# Introduction

In the dev environment we are adding many namespaces for testing purposes only.  They won't make it to other environments.

We may or may not add an ArgoCD app for each of those namespaces. If the namespace is more of a sandbox for someone to test thing, we don't.  If it is more a developement, testing, or pipeline related namespaces, we do.
