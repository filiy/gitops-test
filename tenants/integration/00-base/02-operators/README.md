# Introduction
TODO - We are looking in ways to migrate Operator level installations into while keeping them in the cluster level ArgoCD and keeping it consistent.

We are likely going to see much more in here after OpenShift evolves on the operator side (ex: multiple version per cluster, less right required to install operators, etc.).
