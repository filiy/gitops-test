Base YAML files for namespaces. Point your namespace overlay to one of the kustomization file in the small, medium, or large folder depending on what type of resources you need.
Example: 
Developer Sandbox = small
Basic app deployment with a few service = medium
Heavily used app with dozens of pods and services = large
